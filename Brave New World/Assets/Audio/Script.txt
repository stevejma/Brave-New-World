So you're the FNG.

Listen up! We're on a schedule and deginerates won't catch themselves.

I call targets, you tag them.

Don't sweat the small stuff. The body baggers will handle the situation if you accidentally tag the wrong target. The way they see it,
it's one less issue to deal with. 

Just don't do it too much. If you're just incompetent they'll bag you instead. Remember -- you're equally replaceable.

Keep an eye out for priority targets. Scum of the Earth types; Real shitbirds. You do not want to miss it when they take a dump. 

If you do, we're all fucked.

Now heads up, here's your first target. Check your mission objectives.
